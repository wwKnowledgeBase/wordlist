    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>pentagram</b>,
      a list of five-letter words, includes geographic and personal names, plurals, slang,
      dialect, technical terms, and acronyms, as well as obscene,
      objectionable, obscure and obsolete words, and words that have not
      been uttered in a century, nor used in any written form except
      a crossword puzzle!
    </p>

    <p>
      This list might be useful for
      <a href = "jotto.html">Jotto</a>, or in constructing
      a 5 by 5 word square on the order of the cryptic
      <pre>
        S A T O R
        A R E P O
        T E N E T
        O P E R A
        R O T A S
      </pre>
      which was deemed a sort of charmed inscription, but whose meaning
      is obscure.  If the word "Arepo" is taken as a proper name, it may
      be translated as "Arepo, the sower, delays the wheel with his work",
      or possibly "Arepo, the sower, holds the wheel at work".  Three of
      those words appear on this list.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another use is to construct minimal word ladders, where a single
      letter changes on each step.  To change HEART to STONE:
      <pre>
        HEART
        HEARS
        SEARS
        STARS
        STARE
        STORE
        STONE
      </pre>
      While most five letter words can be connected to others,
      there are troublesome cases (such as POUND to OUNCE) that can
      be helped by an extensive vocabulary.  On the other hand,
      Donald Knuth asserts that "aloof" is "aloof", that is,
      has no neighboring word differing only by one letter.  But then,
      he didn't list "kloof"!
